[variables]
selector {
--var: value;
}
use :root selector for the variables to apply everywhere
to use the variable use var(var-name, fallback)
eg p { color: var(--grey, #fefefe); }

[selectors]
:root -> matches the root element ie :root {rules}

[flexbox]
#content=many:can span multiple lines[justify-content,align-content]
#items=one line[align-items]
- justify-content
    => align content along main axis(for space-<>, extra space is redistributed, so there must be extra
       space for the components to be realigned   
- align-items => align single line flex boxes along cross axis
- align-content => align multiline flex boxes along cross axis
=> main axis depends on flex-direction
- flex-direction => [row(default),column] (elements are always aligned across the main axis)
    => main axis directions:
    => row ---------------->
    => column |
              |
              |
             \|/
              v

- order
    => dictates the position of the elements. order:1 comes before order:2, order:2 before order:3...
       (the smaller number comes first)   
- flex-wrap => whether flex box will allow content along multiple lines[wrap - allow,nowrap - dont allow]
- flex-grow: <n> => how the item will grow relative to the other items in the container
- flex-shrink: <n> => how the item will shrink relative to the other items in the container
- flex-basis: <size> => sets the initial length of a flexible item. When used with the flex shorthand definition, its value is 0. This
  means that it will be assigned the default width for elements of its type
- flex-flow: <direction> <wrap> => shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap
  eg flex-flow: column nowrap; will be equivalent to: flex-direction: column; flex-wrap: nowrap;
- whenever a parent element is transformed into a flexbox container, all the block elements are stretched by
  default to match the height of the tallest element. this is regulated by the property align-items which has a 
  default value of stretch. other values are flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline(makes sure the letters in the
  first line of text sit on the same line)

[overflow]
- controls what happens when items don't fit in an element
- overflow: hidden, scroll, auto, visible

[outline(line drawn around elements. It is not part of the element as it is drawn outside the border)]
outline-width
outline-style
outline-color
outline-offset

[border & outline styles]
solid, dotted, groove, dashed, ridge, inset, none, hidden, double

[transformation - transform property]
transform: <3d/2d transform>
[[2d transforms - transform property]]
translate(x,y)
    -> moves the element x units along the x axis and y units along the y axis in relation to it's initial position
scale(scale factor) -> scale the item along the x and y axis according to the given factor
scaleX(factor) -> scale item along the x axis
scaleY(factor) -> scale item along the y axis
rotate(degrees)
    -> rotates the item clockwise(+ve degrees) or couterclockwise(-ve degrees). Don't forget to use deg eg 30deg
skew(degrees) -> skew element along x and y axis by the given degrees
skewX(degrees) -> skew element along x axis by given degrees
skewY(degrees) -> skew element along y axis by given degrees
matrix(scaleX, skewY, skewX, scaleY, translateX, translateY) -> combines the six translation functions
[[3d transforms]]
rotateX(degrees) -> rotate element along x axis
rotateY(degrees) -> rotate element along y axis
rotateZ(degrees) -> rotate element along z axis
others:
    translate3d(x,y,z)
    matrix3d(4x4 matrix of 16 values)
    perspective(n)
    rotateX(angle)
    rotateY(angle)
    rotate3d(x,y,z,angle)
    translateX(x)
    translateY(y)
    translateZ(z)
    scale3d(x,y,z)
    scaleX(x)
    scaleY(y)
    scaleZ(z)
    
[units of measurement]
absolute - px
percentage - percentage is always relative to the size of an element's parent
relative - to font sizes - em, rem
         - to viewport(browser window) - vw, vh, vmin, vmax
[[ em and rem ]]
em(relative to parent)
-> 2em -> two times the font size of the parent element
-> if the parent element does not have font size set on it, the font size from the nearest parent element is used.
   This is because font-size is an inheritable property
-> The effects can be weird if a parent overrides the font size of it's parent. The font size used by nested elements
   will now be that of the value that overrode the initial one.
   If the size is overriden several times, the effect will compound.
-> However, when em is used on any other property other than font-size, the font size that is looked at is that of the
   current element, not the parent
-> in general therefore, use rem for font-size and em for things like padding and margin
rem(relative to the root element(html element))
         
[max-width and min-width]
-> typically used when the width is set to a dynamic value initially to prevent an item from becoming too big or too
    small
-> eg
 element {width: 90%; max-width: 300px;} =>  don't become too big
 element {width: 20%; min-width: 100px} => don't become too small
 
[font-weight]
bold - jumps to 700(bold)
bolder - jumps to the next available font weight. For instance, if you have 300,400,700 weights and your current
         weight is 300, setting font-weight to bolder will make the font weight to 400
         
[object-fit(for fitting images and videos in a given space)]
-> object-fill: <fill>
-> fill(default)
    => ensure the image's height and width exactly match the height and width provided. Aspect ratio will not be
       maintained if the image's height and width do not exactly match the given dimensions.
-> cover
    => ensure the whole space allocated for the image is occupied. The image may be cropped as is or stretched out
       then cropped to fit in the space. The aspect ratio is maintained
-> contain
    => ensure the image fits wholly in the space allocated. The image may be squeezed to fully fit in. The aspect
       ratio of the image is maintained
-> scale-down
    => image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain
-> none
    => image is not resized

[object-position(dictates how image or video will be positioned in the x and y axis inside its own content box)]
-> object-position: <x>,<y> | <string indicating position>
-> position strings:
    -> left
    -> right
    -> center
 
[media queries]
-> @media <media type> {...rules}
-> @media (<media conditions) {...rules} => evaluates to @media all and (<media conditions>) {...rules}
-> @media (<conditions>) and (<conditions>)...and (<last conditions>) {rules} => combines multiple conditions
-> @media <media type> and (<media conditions>) {...rules}
-> media types:
    - screen => @media screen {}
    - print => @media print {}
    - speech => @media speech{}
-> media conditions:
    - width: min-width, max-width, width => @media (min-width:800px) {}
    - orientation: landscape, portrait => @media (orientation:landscape) {}
    - specific features: hover,focus,active... => @media (hover) {}(apply this only for devices that have the hover
      event)
-> both media types and conditions are optional
-> one of them must however be provided, else we won't have a media query
-> media queries should always come after the default selectors. If this is not done, the default selectors will
   override the media queries and the intended effects will not come out.
-> be as specific as possible so that the effects can be traced back to specific elements

[sections to split css file into]
general
    -> will apply to everything(body{}, html{}, :root{}...). The sections below will specialize for each of the
    elements
typography -> text,font(color, size, family...)
layout -> alignment, padding, display, borders...

[to overlay elements]
-> give the parent element a position of relative, position: relative
-> give the item to move around a position of absolute, position: absolute. It will be positioned absolutely
   relative to its parent element
-> set top, left, right and bottom as needed

[rules of thumb]
-> start with general selectors then specialized ones
-> media queries should come at the very end and should be as specialized as possible
-> split your files into sections(general, typography, layout)
-> do your styling in the same order ie general, typography, layout. The steps are not clearly
   separate but ensure that it is the order that guides the way you write your styles in general
-> break down these sections into sub-sections eg navigation, profile, article, footer...
-> use comments to break down your styles into sections
-> strive as much as possible to limit the number of classes. Specialize only when you need to, don't create more
   classes just because you feel lazy.
-> do things with a mobile first approach(design for small screens first, then add a few other things for the large
   screens)
-> avoid negative margins as much as you can(*there are always exceptions*)
-> when placing margins, check whether the item you are putting the margin on will always be available. If not, use
   a way that will always ensure there will be a margin even when the items are switched(eg use a margin-bottom)
-> breakpoints are not device specific. They are layout specific
