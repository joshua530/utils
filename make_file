say_hello:
        echo "Hello World"

In the example above, say_hello behaves like a function name, as in any programming language. This is called the target. The prerequisites
or dependencies follow the target. For the sake of simplicity, we have not defined any prerequisites in this example. The command 
echo "Hello World" is called the recipe. The recipe uses prerequisites to make a target. The target, prerequisites, and recipes together 
make a rule.

<target>: <prerequisites/dependencies>
	<recipe>
	
Only the first target in the makefile is the default target. Often called the default goal, this is the reason you will see all as the 
first target in most projects. It is the responsibility of all to call other targets. We can override this behavior using a special phony
target called .DEFAULT_GOAL.

.DEFAULT_GOAL := generate(put it at the beginning of the file)
.PHONY: <prerequisites> => where we define all the targets that are not files. make will run its recipe regardless of whether a file 
with that name exists or what its last modification time is.
