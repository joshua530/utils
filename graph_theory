outdegree/branching factor - the number of child nodes for a certain node
digraph - directed graph
graph negative cycle - a cycle whose edges sum up to a negative value
degree of a node - the number of connections that a node has to other nodes in the network
vertex disjoint - vertex-disjoint path means there is not any same node except the end nodes during the path
chain - a sequence of vertices from one vertex to another using the edges
connectivity - the smallest number of vertices/edges whose deletion will cause disconnection of the graph(vertex and edge disconnectivity)
planar graph - graph that can be drawn on a plane so that edges intersect only at their endpoints. ie it is drawable without any edges
intersecting.
articulation vertex - a vertex whose removal leads to disconnection of the graph
chromatic number - the minimum number of colours needed to colour vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph have
the same colour
edge chromatic number/chromatic index - the minimum number of colours needed to colour a graph's edges such that no two edges sharing the
same vertex have the same colour
isomorphism - two graphs(say G and H) are isomorphic if there exists a mapping from G to H such that the two graphs are identical
matching - the problem of finding a mapping(isomorphism) between graphs
automorphism - a mapping of a graph to itself
connected graph - a graph in which there is a path between any two points(you can move from one point to any other point in the graph)

 trees(a tree is a connected graph without cycles)
-------
-> rooted tree - have a designated root node from which other nodes stem
-> free tree - there is no designated root node
