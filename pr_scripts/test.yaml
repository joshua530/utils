	Algorithms are the most important and durable part of computer science because
	they can be studied in a language- and machine-independent way. This means that
	we need techniques that enable us to compare the eï¬ƒciency of algorithms without
	implementing them. Our two most important tools are (1) the RAM model of
	computation and (2) the asymptotic analysis of worst-case complexity.
