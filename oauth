- oauth => framework / standard that gives websites or web applications limited access to users' information located in other applications without needing authentication credentials such as passwords
- parties => client application, user, oauth provider
- grant type dicates the flow that will be used when a client application is using an oauth service

-- grant types --
- authorization code grant type(back channel communication)
- implicit grant type(user's browser communication)


- authorization code -> sent to client application for it to be granted an access token by the oauth service for secure back channel communication

-- oauth request example --
https://oauth-provider.net/auth?client_id=vaglv0mepz3hmaohpjpzv&redirect_uri=https://client-application.net/oauth-login&response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile%20email
- client_id = unique id of client application(provided when client application registers with oauth provider)
- response_type = the type of data returned from the endpoint used(in our case, /auth is the endpoint)
- scope = the data to be accessed and what operations the client application will perform on it
