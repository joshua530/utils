ℝ - set of real numbers. a real number is a value of continous quantity that can represent a distance along a line.
  - real numbers represent points along the infinitely long number line
  - ℝ = ℚ ∪ ℙ
  - in short real numbers are 'real'. They exist in the 'real world'
ℤ - integers
⇔ - if and only if eg do something ⇔ condition -> do something will be considered if and only if the condition is met
Δ | δ - the change in
x̄ (x bar) - some unknown value
ƶ
⊆ - is a subset of. a⊆b -> a is a subset of b. Implies n(a) <= n(b)
⊂ - is a proper subset of. a⊂b -> a is a proper subset of b ie b contains elements not in a. Implies n(a) < n(b)
a∪b - union of a and b. the resulting set will be composed of items present in both a and b(a+b)
a∩b - insersection of a and b. result will contain elements that are common to both a and b
a-b - difference of a and b. result will contain elements of a that are absent in b
~b - approximately/equivalent to b
a⇔b - logical equality(a is logically equal to b|a=b)
expression->expression2 - if then. if expression, then expression2
f:a→b - f takes a as input and returns b
⎣a/b⎦ - get the floor of expression in brackets
⌈x⌉ - get ceiling of expression in brackets
Π(capital pi) denotes a product for a range of numbers
Σ(capital sigma) denotes summation for a range of numbers
≠ - not equal to
|x| - the absolute value of x(without -ve sign)
∅ - empty set
O - big o notation
Ω - bit omega function(like big o notation, used to describe the complexity or performance of an algorithm)
Θ - big theta notation
∈ - is an element of if x∈A, then x is an element of set A
∀ - for all eg ∀x∈A(for all x items that are members of the set A)
| - such that eg ∃x|x>=1 -> there exists an item x such that x is greater than or equal to one
∃ - there exists. eg ∃x∈C|x>0 -> there exists an element x which is a member of set C such that x is greater than zero
ℕ - the set of natural numbers. natural number -> numbers that start from n=1 to n=∞
ℚ - set of rational numbers. a rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with integers. Its decimal form
    either terminates or recurs
ℙ - set of irrational numbers. an irrational number is a real number which cannot be expressed as a fraction. Its decimal form
    never terminates and never repeats eg pi, euler's constant and √2
⇒ - implies
Ac/A'/complement of a set - the elements not in set A. If A is a subset of
the set S, then A' is the set of elements in S that are not in A. ie S-A

[0,4] - the range is inclusive of everything -> 0,1,2,3,4
(0,4] - the range is exclusive of the first element -> 1,2,3,4
[0,4) - the range is exclusive of the last element -> 0,1,2,3
(0,4) - the range is exclusive of both the first and last elements -> 1,2,3

a≡b(mod c) is saying a mod c = b
A modulus cannot be negative. Therefore:
To write -79 mod 17=-11 is not correct; -79 mod 17=6 is correct take 17-11=6 and write that as the result of the modulus
In the same way, -3 mod 7=-3 but it is not correct. -3 mod 7=4 is correct
take 7-3=4 then replace -3 with it
