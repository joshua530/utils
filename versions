[version parts]
a.b.c
a => major(makes incompatible API changes)
b => minor(adds functionality in a backwards compatible manner)
c => patch(makes backward compatible bug fixes)

[the symbols]
^version -> 'compatible with version' - refuses changes to the major version. eg ^3.2.1 allows values between 3.2.1
            and 4.0.0, excluding 4.0.0 since it has a different major version
~version -> 'approximately' - allows for more recent patches, but doesn't accept packages with a different minor 
            version eg ~2.4.5 allows values between 2.4.5 and 2.5.0, excluding 2.5.5 since it has a different minor
            version
=version -> matches exactly the given version
version -> matches exactly the given version
version_a - version_b -> include versions between version_a and version_b
>version
<version
<=version
>=version
[[ composer ]]
wildcard(*) -> a.b.*, a.* - any number can be used in place of the wildcard
space( ) and comma(,) represent logical AND eg >1.0.3 <=2.3.* means version >= 1.0.4 and version <= 2.3.9
double pipe(||) implies logical OR eg 1.0.6||3.2.5 means version = 1.0.6 or version = 3.2.5

[releases]
dev(pre-alpha) -> alpha -> beta -> RC(release candidate) -> stable -> end of life
dev -> not feature complete
    -> not released to public
    -> developers are deciding on features
alpha -> not thoroughly tested
      -> unstable
      -> may not contain all features intended for final version
      -> ends with 'feature freezing' where no more features are added
beta -> features complete
     -> may contain bugs(known & unknown)
     -> released to users for 'usability testing'(beta version)
RC -> beta that is ready for release unless significant bugs emerge
   -> well tested via several beta cycles
stable -> passed all tests
       -> remaining bugs considered acceptable
       -> goes to production
end of life -> deprecated/abandoned/obsolete
            -> maintainer stops patching/adding new features and may choose to release source code to public domain
