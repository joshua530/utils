--- DNS RECORDS ---
 A - address record
---
Address mapped to a web address
example:(foo.bar maps to the given ip address)
foo.bar	A	1.2.32.44


 CNAME - canonical name record
-------
A web address is mapped to a canonical one(one is an 'alias' of the other)
example: (foo.bar is the canonical name for the two addresses)
www.foo.com	CNAME	foo.bar
foo.bar.net	CNAME	foo.bar


 MXNAME - mail exchanger record
--------
Specifies mail server responsible for receiving mail for a domain
example:
Domain			TTL   Class    Type  Priority      Host
foo.bar		1936		IN							MX				10												mail.foo.bar
A domain may have an array of mail servers for load balancing and
redundancy, where one or more of those servers acts as a backup server


 TXT - text record
-----
associates arbitrary text with a host or or other name, such as human 
readable information about a server, network, data center, or other 
accounting information
example:
sam.widgets.com.    IN   TXT   "favorite drink=orange juice"
example.com.   IN   TXT   "This domain name is reserved for use in documentation"



Domain - domain name
Type - record type
Class - class of the record
Ttl - time to live(how long to cache before it is requeried)
Data length - length of the record type-specific data



--- host name resolution ---
Browser -> os -> Resolver(ISP) -> Root server -> TLD(top level domain) server -> Authoritative name server
The resolver's main task is to know the root server
Once the ip address of a host has been found, it is cached so that the query happens faster next time
