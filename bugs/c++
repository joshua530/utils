use std::array contained in array header(#include <array>)

[warning: address of local variable ‘<array_var>’ returned [-Wreturn-local-addr]]
create dynamic array in function and return it as in:
<type> *func() {
  <type> *foo = new <type>[size];
  // do something with foo
  return foo;
}
=> remember to free the memory using delete[] to avoid memory leaks
=> in c, pass in the array as <type>*(maybe use malloc then call free later on???)
