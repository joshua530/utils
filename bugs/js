Converting circular structure to JSON
    --> starting at object with constructor 'Topology'
    |     property 's' -> object with constructor 'Object'
    |     property 'sessionPool' -> object with constructor 'ServerSessionPool'
    --- property 'topology' closes the circle
]

- avoid using this when calling functions inside Observable.pipe
