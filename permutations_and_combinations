permutations; nPk = n!/(n-k)! where n=total number of items; k=number of items to be chosen from the total [ choose without repeating ]
eg how to seat 5 people in 4 chairs. 5*(5-1)*(5-2)*(5-3)*(5-4)=5!/(5-4)!=120
ABCD != DBAC in permutations


combinations; nCk | (n k) = n!/[k!(n-k)!] {binomial coefficient}
eg how to find the number of ways to combine 5 people in 4 chairs
all the ways we can choose 4 people ie 5P4=120
choose any 4 people and as per combination rules, no matter how you arrange
these four people, it will still be the same thing
to eliminate all the extra arrangements and be left with only one way of 
arranging four people, divide the number of total permutations for the five 
people by the total number of permutations for each group of four people 
chosen
ie 5P4/4! = 120/24 = 5
which is equivalent to 5!/[4!(5-4!)] = 5

this is where "for permutation, order matters" ie all the possible 
arrangements for each group of four people chosen matters and "for 
combination, order doesn't matter" ie for each group of four people chosen,
no matter how many times we rearrange these people, it will be considered
one and the same thing

if we have ABCDEF and decide to choose any three letters:
lets choose ABC
for permutation, ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA matter while for combination,
they are all one and the same thing ie they are all equivalent to ABC.
This is why we take all the possible number of permutations divided by all
the number of possible permutaions for each group of items chosen.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE
for ABCDEF, choosing any three will result in 120 different permutations
ie for the 6 letters -> 6*5*4 = 120 | 6!/(6-3)!=120
for each group of 3 letters chosen, there are 3*2*1 possible arrangements
ie 3*2*1 = 6 arrangements | 3!/(3-3)! = 6
To eliminate all the clutter due to the rearrangement of each individual
group of 3 letters chosen, we divide all the possible permutations by the
number of permutaions for every group of three elements
ie 120/6 = 20
this is the same as n!/[k!(n-k)!) -> 6!/[3!(6-3!)] = 20
this is how the combination formula comes about

PHEW!!!
