a service can be configured as a standalone systemd service file or as a forked process

standalone
  - all the configurations are done in the service config file and no external shell scripts are run
  - the direct path to the binary is given to the file
forked
  - shell scripts are provided. some configuration is done in the config file, then the path to a given shell
    script is given to the file as the executable

Directories for saving the files:
/etc/systemd/system
/etc/systemd/user

systemctl daemon-reload - force systemd to update its database of enabled services instead of waiting for a reboot
systemctl enable service
systemctl start service
systemctl disable service
systemctl reload service
