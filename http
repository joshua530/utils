HSTS
  - http strict transport security
  - allows web servers to tell browsers / other agents that they should only
    communicate with the server using https - uses the "Strict-Transport-Security" header.
  - it is more secure than a 301 redirect in which the first http request before redirection is still vulnerable
    to man in the middle attacks.
