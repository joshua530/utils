record ----field---field---field----
record ----field---field---field----
record = horizontal
field = vertical

like in databases, a record is a row, and a field is a column of the row
RS = input record separator(separates the lines)
ORS = output record separator(character that will split each line in the output)
FS = input field separator(separates the 'letters' | chunks of each line)
OFS = output field separator(character that will split each record chunk in the output)

awk 'BEGIN {RS=""} {gsub(/\s+/,""); print $1}'
gsub(<pattern to substitute>, <substitute with>) - perform global substitution
$1 - first field. if FS is not given, the default will be "" which means that $1 will be equivalent to the whole
line by default
if the number is not given to print, $1 is printed by default
RS="" means there is no line separator hence the whole input will be taken as a single line
